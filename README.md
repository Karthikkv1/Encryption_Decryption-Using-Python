# Encryption and Decryption App

This Python application allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a secret key. It utilizes the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the base64 module for encoding and decoding messages.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypt any text message using a secret key.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt previously encrypted messages using the same secret key.
- **Password Protection**: Requires users to input a password (secret key) for both encryption and decryption.
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows users to reset the input fields to start over.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install pybase64
   ```
3. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main program using Python:
   ```
   python encryption_decryption_app.py
   ```
2. Enter the text you want to encrypt/decrypt in the provided text area.
3. Enter the secret key in the password field.
4. Click on the "ENCRYPT" button to encrypt the text or the "DECRYPT" button to decrypt it.
5. If the password is incorrect or not provided, an error message will be displayed.
6. Use the "RESET" button to clear the input fields and start over.
